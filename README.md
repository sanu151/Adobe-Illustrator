# Adobe-Illustrator

Adobe Illustrator is the industry-leading vector graphics editor and design software developed and marketed by Adobe Inc. It's a powerful tool used by graphic designers, illustrators, and artists to create a wide range of visual content.

Here's a breakdown of what Adobe Illustrator is, its key features, common uses, pricing, and the latest version:

### What is Adobe Illustrator?

Unlike raster graphics editors like Adobe Photoshop (which work with pixels), Illustrator creates **vector graphics**. This means artwork in Illustrator is made up of mathematical equations that define points, lines, and curves. The key advantage of vector graphics is that they can be **scaled infinitely up or down without any loss of quality or resolution**. This makes them ideal for logos, icons, and illustrations that need to appear sharp and clear across various sizes and mediums, from business cards to billboards.
